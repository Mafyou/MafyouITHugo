## How to be more productive in your computer? 

How to be more organized?
How to speed up?  
How to find the information quicker?  

All this questions will be surronded by answers. ;-)  
On thing for sure, you will change your habits !  
(Windows > 8, Mac, Linux.)

## How to send something code sur le net?

You just have to subscribe and let it...  ;-)  
It's simple, you just have to have "curiosity".

## How developers can communicate each day?

It's silly, same as him, he suggested me "auto-gestion".

The goal, it to do the project (the best you can?) No ?  
Well, how do "they" connect to be organized ?  
Here we go ?
